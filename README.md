# Airline-passengers-satisfaction

You work as a consultant for an airline. The airline is interested in knowing if a better in-flight entertainment experience leads to higher customer satisfaction. They would like you to construct and evaluate a model that predicts whether a future customer would be satisfied with their services given previous customer feedback about their flight experience.

The data for this activity is for a sample size of 129,880 customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and in-flight entertainment, among others. Your goal will be to utilize a binomial logistic regression model to help the airline model and better understand this data.
